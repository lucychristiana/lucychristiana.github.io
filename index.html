    <h3> Mini Life Story</h3>
    <p>
   I was born and raised in a small town called Thomaston in northwestern Connecticut. In November of my freshman year at Bard, 
   my parents moved to Portland, Oregon where I now (sort of live). I never knew anyone who had gone to Bard, I really just found
   it through the internet, but I am happy to be here!

    <h3> Why do I enjoy coding/computer programming/ computer science?</h3>
    <p>
    As a Biology major, I have to take two science classes outside of the Biology department. Because I am interested in working
    in public health, my advisor--the wonderful Arseny Khakhalin--recommended that I take some CS classes. I started out with Object
    Oriented Programming with Robots last semester and since I enjoyed the subject, I will be continuing with CS next semester by
    taking Data Structures. I like coding because it gives you control over data and information that is not possible with
    any other form of creation.
