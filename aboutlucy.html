      Hello! My name is Lucy I'm a rising sophomore at Bard College. Officially, I am majoring in biology--but I am currently trying to join that with sociology. 
      I started taking CS classes my second semester of my freshman year and ended up really enjoying it and the control it gave me over data and information.
      Next semester I will be continuing with Data Structures, so feel free to ask me about taking CS classes as a non-major if you want!
